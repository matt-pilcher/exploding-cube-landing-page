The landing page is built with Next.js and uses Three.js to display an interactive 3D model of a cube. Grab the cube to expand the individual pieces outward. This animation also triggers when you submit the form

The model and animation was built using Blender. I converted the .blend file to a .glb so the 3d model can be used in a browser environment.

I also added a light/dark mode toggle.
